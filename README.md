# Credit Card Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview
This is my first personal Python project, created to apply what I have learned through self-learning and coursework.  
The objective of this project is to analyze customer data and build machine learning models to predict customer churn based on various customer-related factors.

This project reflects my learning journey in Python, data processing, and machine learning, and it will continue to be improved as I gain more experience.

---

## Objectives
- Apply data cleaning and preprocessing techniques to real-world data
- Explore and compare multiple machine learning models for churn prediction
- Understand key factors that influence customer churn
- Build an end-to-end machine learning workflow

---

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

---

## Data Processing
The following data preparation steps were performed:
- Handling missing values
- Feature selection and transformation
- Encoding categorical variables
- Scaling and preparing data for model training

---

## Machine Learning Models
The following models were implemented and evaluated:
- Logistic Regression (baseline)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Naive Bayes
- Random Forest
- AdaBoost
- Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

These models were compared to understand their performance and trade-offs in predicting customer churn.

## Key Learnings
Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in:
- Writing structured and readable Python code
- Applying data preprocessing techniques using Pandas and NumPy
- Training and evaluating multiple machine learning models
- Understanding model strengths, limitations, and performance metrics
- Iteratively improving code and results

## Project Status
🚧 **Ongoing**

This project is still being actively improved. As I continue learning through school and self-study, I plan to:
- Improve feature engineering
- Perform more extensive model tuning
- Add clearer evaluation metrics and visualizations
- Refactor and optimize the codebase
